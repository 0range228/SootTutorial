# Soot Tutorial
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/noidsirius/SootTutorial.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/noidsirius/SootTutorial)

This repository contains (will contain) several simple examples of static program analysis in Java using [Soot](https://github.com/Sable/soot).

Since the stable version of Soot does not support Java 9+ (with modules) yet, make sure the class files that you want to analyze are compiled with Java 8.
